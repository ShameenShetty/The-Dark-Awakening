# The-Dark-Awakening
The Dark Awakening is a horror game using First Person perspective

# Objective:
You wake up in an seemingly abandoned house, that is dark. All you have is a flashlight with you that you must conserve. You need to investigate the house a bit more, to understand its mysteries and along the way access the circuit boxes scattered throughout the house to turn on the lights.
However, after turning on all the circuits, something sinister awakens in the house

# Note/Disclaimer:
* Due to the massive size of the project and the asset packs used (e.g: one of the assets packs was 1.65 GB) I have added the Assets folder to gitignore in order to be able upload the project to GitHub without issues.
* Due to my limited time as classes are from 9:30 to 5 pm, after which I have to work on assignments as well as my personal programming projects, I have used assets in order to shorten the time needed to make a level - this is limited to assets such as physical assets (furniture, materials, props) and some sound assets (horror background

# Plans:
Due to my schedule where I am currently working on some projects as well as my studies, I had limited time to work on *The Dark Awakening*, a problem made more difficult due to my unfamiliarity with the Unity game engine - while I was learning Unity I was also making the game. Due to this there are a lot of things that I wanted to add, but did not get the time to do so, and will have to learn
For this game I had planned on adding Lovecraftian themes, as well as looking to other games such as *Still Wakes the Deep*, *Bloodborne* (Insight mechanic in particular) for inspiration.
